# 🧠 Introduction to NLP (Natural Language Processing)

## 🔍 What is NLP?

**Natural Language Processing (NLP)** is a field of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** that focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human languages. It brings together **linguistics**, **computer science**, and **machine learning** to bridge the gap between human communication and machine understanding.

### 🔑 Key Goals of NLP:
- Understand and process human language (like English, Urdu, etc.)
- Convert text or speech into structured data
- Perform tasks like translation, summarization, sentiment analysis, chatbots, etc.

### 🧠 Real-life Applications:
- **Google Translate** – Language translation
- **Siri, Alexa** – Voice assistants
- **ChatGPT** – Conversational AI
- **Spam Filters** – Email classification
- **Auto-correct** – Spelling and grammar correction

## 🛠️ Hands-on Demonstration in NLP

A **hands-on demonstration** means practically implementing NLP techniques using code, usually with Python and NLP libraries. It helps students understand how NLP is applied to real-world problems.

### 🔬 Example Hands-on Activities:

#### 1. Text Preprocessing
- **Tokenization**: Breaking text into individual words or tokens
- **Removing Stop Words**: Eliminating common words (e.g., "is", "the", "and")
- **Stemming / Lemmatization**: Reducing words to their root form

#### 2. Sentiment Analysis
- Determining if a text is **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral**

#### 3. Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- Identifying names of **people**, **locations**, **organizations**, etc.

#### 4. Building a Simple Chatbot
- Creating a basic chatbot using NLP libraries

### 🧰 Common Tools & Libraries:
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - `NLTK` (Natural Language Toolkit)
  - `spaCy`
  - `TextBlob`
  - `Transformers` by Hugging Face

## 📚 Example Code for Sentiment Analysis

```python
from textblob import TextBlob

text = "I love studying NLP. It's amazing!"
blob = TextBlob(text)

print("Sentiment:", blob.sentiment)
print("Tokens:", blob.words)
```
## Output 
```
Sentiment: Sentiment(polarity=0.625, subjectivity=0.6)
Tokens: ['I', 'love', 'studying', 'NLP', 'It', "'s", 'amazing']
```
